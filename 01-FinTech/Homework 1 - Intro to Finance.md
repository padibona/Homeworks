# AAVE - Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Domain

## Overview and Origin
Aave was initially founded on 1-5-2017 as ETHLend by Stani Kulechov and Emilio Frangella. The founders wanted to create the first lending protocol on the Ethereum network. ETHLend was the first iteration of this, and was initially a Person to Person (P2P) Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending protocol.  There was an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for the LEND token from Nov 25-29 2017, which garnered $17,860,000 in funding.

After the ICO, the founders stated that they were starting a parent company Aave, which would be composed of EthLend, Aave Pocket, Aave Lending, Aave Custody, Aave Clearing and Aave gaming. Initial token holders were allowed to swap their tokens from LEND to AAVE governance token at a ratio of 100:1 in October 2020.

From 2017-2020 Aave company was able to secure around $56 million in funding which included the proceeds of the token sales as well as some Venture Capital Funds. Here is a rough breakdown of the funding sources:
* Token Sales: $24 million
* Venture Capital Investors: Approximately $32.5 Million
        * Tether - Unknown amount
        * ParaFi - $4.5 million
        * Framework Ventures & Three Arrows Capital - $3 million
        * Blockchain Capital, Standard Crypto & others - $25 million

## Business Activities:
The current Aave protocol is no longer a P2P lending protocol, but is instead a liquidity market protocol that uses a liquidity pool approach. This allows a user to be able to deposit their crypto (into a liquidity pool) and gain variable interest. It also allows users to borrow funds against those deposits with either a variable or fixed interest rate.

Anyone that holds crypto (even the unbanked) can deposit their crypto currencies and borrow against them in a fully decentralized manner. Aave does not hold your crypto at all, they just supply the protocol that allows users to transfer funds using smart contracts. Right now, as seen from the https://aave.com/ website, there is around $18.3 Billion of value in the network. Considering the overall Total Value Locked (TVL) in all of DeFi is around $97 Billion (according to https://www.coingecko.com/en/defi), Aave has around 19% of the market share, which is pretty huge. Aave offers a very smooth user experience, which will attract customers as the learning curve on DeFi is pretty steep. 

There is a very large prohibiting factor to adoption of DeFi on Ethereum, which are the gas prices (in ETH or GWEI) for executing smart contracts on the Ethereum Network. To combat this problem, the Aave team has decided to partner and integrate with Polygon (formerly Matic), which is a level 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that uses side chains. The gas fees on the Polygon network are orders of magnitude smaller, which has boosted the overall TVL for Aave to well above Compound and Maker's. This opens up the greater DeFi lending ecosystem to a much larger audience including smaller crypto holders. While I wouldn't say this would be an unfair advantage as any other protocol could integrate with the Polygon network, it does give Aave the current advantage in the DeFi lending space.

One of the drawbacks of the current Aave setup is the fact that all of the deposited assets are grouped into one total collateral total. While this makes it easy to borrow against any of the assets deposited, I think it may be a bit oversimplified. I would prefer to have control over each loan, by choosing the asset I wanted to be used for collateral for each loan. Instead, the users only have the ability to toggle an asset's availability for collateral. 

## Landscape:

Aave is in the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency domain of Fin Tech with a sub-sector of DeFi. Aave has a couple large competitors in the decentrlized crypto lending protocol arena: Maker and Compound. Both of these lending providers offer similar services, where you can deposit/earn interest and borrow within the same protocol. This domain has only been around since 2009 and DeFi as a sub-sector has only really been around for about 4 years. DeFi as a sub-sector was very hot in the summer of 2020 and it certainly seems like the DeFi space will heat up once again within the next year or so as there are so many projects coming up with unique solutions. 

Some hot trends in crypto are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), DeFi and Ethereum scaling solutions. The DeFi space in particular is extremely disruptive as it could replace traditional banking as we know it, but there is still a lot of work to be done. 

## Results

Compared to Compound and Maker, I would say Aave is certainly leading in terms of the value of the governance token. In the last year Aave has seen explosive growth in the price of the governance token AAVE at a whopping 1753% growth, while Maker's MKR token has only seen a 393% gain and Compound's COMP token has only seen a 21% gain.

## Recommendations

While I think Aave has a great head start on the other lending protocols, I think they need to continue to push forward with adding more ecosystems similar to the Polygon integration. Even the Polygon network has seen congestion since the integration was spun up (personal experience). That goes to show how much demand there is for a decentralized financial network. I also think they should add some flexibility for users to choose which assets they want to use as collateral for specific loans as opposed to just turning on/off the ability for that asset to be used as collateral, period. Bottom line is I think Aave will be around for a long time and will likely lead the DeFi lending space for the next year or so. I personally paid for school using Aave on the Polygon Network as the fees to deposit assets and move things around were actually quite reasonable. The hardest part was getting my crypto onto the Polygon Mainnet.
